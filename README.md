# Basic-Graphing-Calculator-Java-

I wrote this Graphing Calculator for my Diploma Project in High School. Please see my webpage theoxo.github.io for further information.

Note that I have chosen to upload this source code to github retroactively without making any changes to it. It is absolutely ridden with bugs, poor coding practices and weird design, so chances are if you enjoy Java (or any similiar programming language, really) you'll feel slightly sick after looking at it. 

Enjoy.
